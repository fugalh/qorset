Q: Qorset?
A: My take on the wondershaper (http://lartc.org/wondershaper/).

Q: Groan
A: Yeah

Q: What was wrong with wondershaper?
A: It's old, a little opaque, didn't work on OpenWRT out of the box, and I just
had my own ideas of how to set it up. But I liked the idea of a simple
almost-zero-config QoS script so I tried to generalize mine in the same fashion
as the original.

Q: X doesn't work!
A: Read the README and HOWTO, and if that doesn't help, drop me a line. If you
have trouble but figure it out on your own, drop me a line or even better a
patch so that others can benefit in the future.
