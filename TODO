- apparently this IFB thing replaces IMQ, and doesn't require any kernel or
  iptables mods. Figure out how to use it, and whether it's applicable on
  openwrt.

- Divide qorset into two versions: full and openwrt. probably have common code
  (perhaps by sourcing or perhaps by concatenation from makefile)

- decide whether to do DREGS_PORTS et al or DREGS_[SD]PORTS, and make it consistent.
    do in/out ports AND/OR bilateral, for all kinds

- detect VOIP?
- release stuff
- l7 user configuration?
- quantum size or r2q
