See the comments at the top of qorset.sh for configuration.

It's still rough around the edges, but do try it and if it doesn't work let me
know and I'll work with you and we'll polish it up. Patches welcome.

Requirements:
    iproute2
    tc
    iptables
    l7-filter
    imq
    htb kernel module
    sfq kernel module

See the file HOWTO for terse but hopefully-helpful instructions on getting your
kernel and iptables up to speed.

# Getting Started
First, establish a performance baseline so you know if it's working. Begin by
doing a bandwidth speed test on an otherwise quiet line to figure out what your
actual speeds are. Run a few tests at a few different servers and take the
average. Then, set up a ping to a remote server. Note the average latency
(probably < 100ms). Then do something like a bandwidth speed test or scp a big
file, and watch the latency skyrocket. This is bad. 

Now, set the bandwidth cap in qorset.conf to HALF of your bandwidth up and
down. Start qorset (./qorset.sh) and repeat the experiment. You should see the
latency stays pretty low even during a bulk transfer. If not, something's
wrong.

Now, independently adjust the bandwidth caps from halfway between where it is
to your measured max bandwidth, rerun qorset, and confirm that your ping
latencies remain low while doing a bulk transfer. Repeat until you find the
best bandwidth that doesn't impact your latency. 

To disable qorset just run './qorset.sh stop'.
