Your linux distribution may not have l7-filter and/or IMQ support in the kernel
and/or iptables. In that case, follow these general directions.

# iptables
Get the iptables sources and apply the appropriate IMQ patch, and copy the
l7-filter files into place, per the respective instructions. You will need to
tell configure where to find the kernel headers.

Build and install.

# kernel
Get the kernel sources and configure them as you normally would. If you've
never compiled a kernel before, there are many guides on the web.

Apply the l7-filter and IMQ patches to the kernel and 'make oldconfig'.

Build and install the kernel.

Reboot.

# setup
Make sure you can load the modules (imq, xt_layer7), and probably set up your
distribution to auto-load them (/etc/modules).
